# EDA – Risk Analytics in Banking and Financial Services

This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on loan application data to assess credit risk and identify patterns in customer defaults. The analysis focuses on understanding the impact of consumer and loan attributes on repayment behavior to support data-driven lending decisions.

## 🔍 Objective
To identify key factors that influence loan approval and default, enabling financial institutions to improve risk assessment and lending strategies.

## 📊 Dataset
- Sample loan application dataset (CSV format)
- Includes features like loan amount, income, credit history, purpose, and repayment status.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📈 Key Insights
- Identified attributes highly correlated with default risk.
- Applied data cleaning, null value treatment, and feature categorization.
- Visualized patterns using histograms, box plots, correlation heatmaps, and bar charts.
